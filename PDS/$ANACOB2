Yet another possible piece of rabbit-hole-ware :-)

 Subject: Re: COBOL list options


Hello,

I agree with putting my program on the public domain.
Here is a zip file of a program able to list COBOL II options.
I wrote all necessary instructions inside it, in order to make it
work for COBOL for MVS.

Greetings from France.

>Hello,

 Would you be interested in putting the COBOL list options
 programs on the public domain CBT tape collection?  I am sure
 others would benefit from your tools.

 If so could you possibliy send me good copies as the ones that
 went out on the mailing list were somewhat garbled.
